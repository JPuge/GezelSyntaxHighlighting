Gezel Syntax Highlighting
=======================

This project contains necessary files to add syntax highlighting for the Gezel programming language to Sublime Text and Textmate.

Sublime Text installation
---------------------------

To add syntax highlighting open Sublime Text 2 and go to Preferences > Browse packages. This opens the package folder. Create a new folder called Gezel and place all the files from the repo in the folder. Restart Sublime, and Gezel syntax highlighting is now installed.
